## Husky Overview

### Introduction

Husky is a rugged, outdoor-ready unmanned ground vehicle (UGV), suitable for research and rapid prototyping applications.
These tutorials will assist you with setting up and operating your Husky. The tutorial topics are listed in
the right column and presented in the suggested reading order.

:::note

These tutorials assume that you are comfortable working with ROS. We recommend starting with our
[ROS tutorial](https://www.clearpathrobotics.com/assets/guides/noetic/ros/index.html) if you are not familiar with ROS already.

:::note

These tutorials specifically target Husky robots running Ubuntu 20.04 with ROS Noetic, as it is the standard
OS environment for Husky. If instead you have an older Husky robot running Ubuntu 18.04 with ROS Melodic,
please follow [this tutorial](https://www.clearpathrobotics.com/assets/guides/melodic/melodic-to-noetic/index.html)
to upgrade the robot OS environment to Ubuntu 20.04 with ROS Noetic.

[Husky ROS Packages](#husky-ros-packages) provides the references for the software packages and key ROS topics.

[Husky Software Setup](#husky-software-setup) outlines the steps for setting up the software on
your Husky robot and optionally on a remote computer.

[Using Husky](#using-husky) describes how to simulate and drive your Husky. [Simuation](#simulating-husky)
is a great way for most users to learn more about their Husky; understanding how to effectively operate Husky
in simulation is valuable whether you are in the testing phase with software you intend to ultimately deploy on a
physical Husky, or you do not have one and are simply exploring the platform's capabilities.
[Driving Husky](#driving-husky) covers how to teleoperate Husky using the remote control, as well as safety
procedures for operating the physical robot. Anyone working with a physical robot should be familiar with this section.

[Navigating Husky](#navigating-husky) is a follow-on to what is learned in the [Simuation](#simulating-husky)
tutorial, as navigation and map-making may be run in the simulated environment. However, this content is applicable
to both the simulator and the real platform, if your Husky is equipped with a laser scanner.

[Husky Tests](#testing-husky) outlines how to validate that your physical Husky is working correctly.

[Advanced Topics](#advanced-topics) covers items that are only required in atypical situations.
