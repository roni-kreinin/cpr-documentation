Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is a method of generating a map and tracking the robots location within the map. It is generally done using
laser scan data from a LIDAR, and the robots odometry. For this demo we will be using the [slam_toolbox](https://github.com/SteveMacenski/slam_toolbox) package to map our environment.
