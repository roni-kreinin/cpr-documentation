Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is a method of generating a map and tracking the robots location within the map. It is generally done using
laser scan data from a LIDAR, and the robots odometry. For this demo we are using the [slam_toolbox](https://github.com/SteveMacenski/slam_toolbox) package to map our environment. This tutorial will use the [Clearpath simulator](../simulator/overview), but will work on a physical robot too. We will be using a J100 with a Hokuyo UST10 attached to the front of the robot. The `robot.yaml` is available here. <---TODO
