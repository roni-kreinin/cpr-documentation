## Operating System (OS) {#operating-system}

ROS 2 Humble uses [Ubuntu 22.04](https://releases.ubuntu.com/jammy/) as its Tier 1 operating system. Though other operating systems are supported,
it is highly recommended to use Ubuntu 22.04. For the robot PC, Ubuntu 22.04 Server should be installed. The server version of the OS will not install a
graphical user interface (GUI).

## Networking

Once the operating system is installed, the robot PC needs to be connected to the internet. TODO.

## Clearpath Package Server

The Clearpath package server needs to be added to the robot PC to access robot packages.

Configure Ubuntu's APT package manager to add the package server:

1. Install the authentication key for the packages.clearpathrobotics.com repository. In terminal, run:

```
wget https://packages.clearpathrobotics.com/public.key -O - | sudo apt-key add -
```

2. Add the debian sources for the repository. In terminal, run:

```
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb https://packages.clearpathrobotics.com/stable/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/clearpath-latest.list'
```

3. Update your computerâ€™s package cache. In terminal, run:

```
sudo apt-get update
```

## Clearpath Robot metapackage

Once the Clearpath package server has been added, the [Clearpath Robot](https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/clearpath_robot) metapackage can be installed.

```
sudo apt install ros-humble-clearpath-robot
```

Installing this package will also install all dependencies required to run any Clearpath robot and supported sensors, other than Clearpath firmware packages.
